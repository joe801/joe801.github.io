## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt some functions and codes I've never used or had to used before like;

```html
<div onclick="document.calc.txt.value +='.'">.</div>
```
```css
.tw-toggle input[value="true"]:checked ~ span{
  background: var(--equal-background);
  left: 39px;
}
```
```js
document.body.classList.add("theme2");
 document.body.classList.remove("body");
```

### Continued development

I want to work on making my codes shorter.

### Useful resources

I learnt the new stuff I know working on this project from Gooogle. AS the saying goes; "as a developer, Google is your best friend".
